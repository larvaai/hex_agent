"""lens_skill_usage.py — skill-invocation frequency from telemetry
invocations.jsonl: which skills are hot, and which HARNESS-OWNED (hs:*) skills
are never invoked in the window. Pure gather → render-agnostic dict. READ-ONLY.

"Never used" is only meaningful for owned skills: a vendored/third-party skill
sitting unused is expected, an hs:* skill nobody invokes is a trim candidate the
LLM can RAISE (never auto-remove). Fail-soft on telemetry (bad lines skipped);
the catalog read fails soft to an empty owned set rather than crashing the lens.
