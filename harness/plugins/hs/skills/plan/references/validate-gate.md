# Validate gate — critical-questions interview (on-demand)

Runs AFTER red-team. Goal: every decision the plan is currently SELF-ASSUMING must
be explicitly finalized by the user before cook invests effort in the wrong direction.

## Mode (taken from `## Plan Context`, default is interactive)

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `interactive` (default) | ask the user via AskUserQuestion (see Asking rules) |
| `headless` | Do NOT ask (subagent/headless has no TTY): EMIT a table "Validation Questions + suggested defaults" into `## Validation Log` (one row per question: `VL-n \| question \| suggested default \| reason`), then continue with the defaults. A later interactive session or cook can read the table and override. |
| `off` | skip the validate step (only when the caller declares it explicitly). |

## Verification pass (before asking or emitting)

Re-read the plan + red-team disposition and collect: decisions with no owner
(who finalizes? when?), assumptions without evidence, unweighed trade-offs, invented
thresholds, **and every `[UNVERIFIED]` tag** left by the planner (two-way Evidence
Filter — rule verification-mechanism). Each item becomes ONE question — merge
duplicates, drop questions answerable by reading the repo (Scout First).

To make the scan systematic, sweep the plan text for these keyword triggers and bucket
each hit into a question category — the keyword is the tell that a decision is implicit:

| Category | Keywords that flag an implicit decision |
|---|---|
| **Architecture** | "approach", "pattern", "design", "structure", "database", "API" |
| **Assumptions** | "assume", "expect", "should", "will", "must", "default" |
| **Trade-offs** | "tradeoff", "vs", "alternative", "option", "either/or" |
| **Risks** | "risk", "might", "could fail", "dependency", "blocker", "concern" |
| **Scope** | "phase", "MVP", "future", "out of scope", "nice to have" |

Tag each question with its category in the Validation Log so phase propagation knows the
target section (Architecture→Architecture, Scope→Implementation Steps, Risk→Risk, etc.).

**Escalation (Architecture / Trade-offs):** when a flagged decision is *load-bearing*, *costly to
reverse*, AND the alternatives differ on a MEASURABLE axis, do not just ask the user to guess —
propose `hs-think:bakeoff` (build cheap probes, decide by numbers) and lock the plan on the winning
direction. Only when no mechanical metric exists does this stay a judgment question.

## Present before asking (MANDATORY)

Before the first question, output a brief visible recap in the response: the plan's
phases, the key decisions, and the assumptions/risks this interview will probe (5–10
bullets). The interview often runs in a fresh session where the user has not seen the
plan body — a question referencing unseen plan content appears to come from nowhere.
Extended-thinking reasoning is invisible; externalize it first.

Write each question and option to stand alone: name the plan section or decision it
refers to instead of assuming earlier turn text is still on screen.

## Asking rules

1. Ask via AskUserQuestion; place the recommended option FIRST and mark it
   "(Recommended)". When the question is about *approving a plan/artifact*
   (not choosing config), offer `Direct Review (Plannotator)` first
   (rule `harness/rules/plannotator-review-gates.md`): `annotate` on `plan.md`,
   and annotations return as decisions.
2. At most 4 questions per round; open a new round if more remain. A long interview
   is fine — a wrong decision is costly.
3. User overriding the recommended option is normal: record it, do NOT argue back
   unless there is new evidence (rule `harness/rules/verification-mechanism.md`,
   "User decision").

## Recording results

- **Validation Log in plan.md, verbatim decisions** (table: VL-n | topic
  | decision | record DEC?): the log is the source of truth when context is compressed.
- Architecture decisions -> DEC via `decision_register.py --append-alloc` immediately.
- Propagate every decision into the affected phase files (mark as updated).
- Gate pass condition: **Failed: 0** — no blocking question remains open. Unresolved
  non-blocking items may stay; record clearly which wave will resolve them.
