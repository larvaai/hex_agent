# hs-mem:journal — technical journal

Write an honest technical journal entry to `docs/journals/` via the
`journal-writer` agent. Do **NOT** write code; do **NOT** create markdown
outside `docs/journals/` or `plans/` (CLAUDE.md rule #5).

A journal entry is not a ticket: write truthfully, including emotions; do not
soften failures.

## When to use

| Situation | Example |
|---|---|
| After ship / implement | session reflection, decisions that were finalized |
| After bug fix | root cause + lessons learned |
| Active incident | repeated test failures, migration crash, vulnerability found |
| Architecture change | initial direction was wrong; record why |

No argument: `AskUserQuestion` — ask the journal topic.

## Process

1. **Parse argument** — identify the topic; if missing, ask the user.
2. **Delegate to journal-writer** — spawn agent `journal-writer` with context:
   topic, path `docs/journals/`, requirement for honesty + specific technical detail.
3. **Entry structure** — agent follows the format in `references/entry-format.md`;
   file named `YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` in `docs/journals/`.
4. **Verify** — after the agent completes: confirm the file actually exists and is not empty.

Entry format details: `references/entry-format.md`.
When to write: `references/when-to-journal.md`.

## Agent wiring

```
journal-writer (harness/plugins/hs/agents/journal-writer.md)
  └── writes file → docs/journals/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md
```

The `journal-writer` agent uses model `haiku` — lightweight, sufficient for
prose reflection. It creates/edits files only in `docs/journals/` and does not
touch harness code.

## Cross-references

- **hs-mem:retro** — analyzes git history data; journal records subjective reflection.
  Use both after a sprint: retro for metrics, journal for human lessons.
- **hs:ship** — journal immediately after ship to capture last-minute decisions.
- **hs:cook** — journal after implementing when the approach changed mid-stream.

## Boundaries

- Do NOT write code or modify files outside `docs/journals/`.
- Journal does not replace a plan or decision register: it adds the human perspective.
- `journal-writer` confirms the file was actually created before reporting done.
- On close: return the absolute path of the new entry.

## HARD-GATE (actual wiring)

No dedicated hard gate for journal. However:
- Markdown must reside in `docs/journals/`: creating it elsewhere violates CLAUDE.md rule #5.
- `harness/hooks/gate_stage.py` still runs if the journal workflow triggers any stage.
